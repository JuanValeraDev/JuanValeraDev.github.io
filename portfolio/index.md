Hi, I'm Juan, a passionate full stack developer currently working at NTT Data Murcia on a project for IVI.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve gone from practicing and learning to code to working in a professional environment where teamwork and collaboration are essential.

Iâ€™m gaining valuable experience with Kanban workflows using tools like Jira and Bitbucket, and developing with the Servoy framework.

Beyond coding, Iâ€™m also growing from a DevOps perspective â€” understanding the bigger picture of the applicationâ€™s ecosystem, service communications, integrations, and monitoring with Datadog. 

This allows me to not only write code, but also understand how everything fits together to deliver reliable, scalable solutions.

Iâ€™m still the same passionate, curious, and committed professional who loves learning every day â€” only now Iâ€™m doing it while contributing to a real-world, large-scale project.

Want to see what I can do? Check out my projects and experience. ðŸ˜‰
