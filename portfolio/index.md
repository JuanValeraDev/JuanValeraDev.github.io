Hi, I’m Juan — a passionate full-stack developer currently at **[Digio](https://digio.es/en/)**, working within an agile team focused on cutting-edge AI for web development.

Over the years, I’ve grown from practising and learning to code into collaborating professionally to build impactful digital solutions. Now I apply that drive to real-world problems within a dynamic environment.

At Digio, I work with technologies such as React and Angular on the frontend, relational databases like PostgreSQL and NoSQL options like MongoDB, full-stack frameworks including TanStack Start and NestJS, and ORMs such as Drizzle. On top of that, our team lives and breathes AI-powered agents — it’s our day-to-day rhythm.

Beyond writing code, I’m expanding my view towards the full ecosystem: orchestrating service communications, integrations, and monitoring, and contributing to delivering robust, scalable digital products.

I remain the same curious, committed professional who loves to learn every day — only now, I’m doing it while building the future of web development at Digio.

Want to see what I can do? Dive into my projects and experience. 😉
