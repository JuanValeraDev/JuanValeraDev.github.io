Hi, I'm Juan, a passionate full stack developer. 

I have spent more than 3 years **practicing** and **learning** to
code, and now **I know how to get things done**. 

I have learned to seek information. I have learned to understand
the docs. I have learned to find my way to the solution.

I practice almost every day. I am continuously learning.

And I am looking for a job <b>right now</b>.

So if **you** need someone who knows how to work with computers, but also with humans. If **you** are looking for a programmer
who is capable of learning with the same kindness for teaching. If **you** want to have in your team a passionate, funny,
reliable, humble, and committed professional... say no more: you are in the **right place**.

Interested? Check my projects and resume to know me better. ;)
